# 🔧 DUPLICATE ACCOUNTS FIX

## The Problem

Every page refresh was adding duplicate accounts to "Your calendars" because:

1. **App.tsx** loaded accounts from localStorage on startup
2. **AutoRestoreAuth** validated the same accounts and called `addAccount()` again
3. **`addAccount()`** was adding them instead of replacing them

## ✅ The Solution

### 1. **Centralized Account Management**

Created `useAccountManager` hook that handles:

- ✅ Initial loading from localStorage
- ✅ Token validation and refresh
- ✅ Duplicate prevention
- ✅ Unified storage management

### 2. **Eliminated Duplicate Systems**

- ❌ Removed `AutoRestoreAuth` component (was redundant)
- ❌ Removed separate account loading in App.tsx
- ❌ Removed old token refresh useEffect
- ✅ Single source of truth for account management

### 3. **Smart Duplicate Prevention**

```typescript
// Now checks for existing emails before adding
const existingIndex = current.findIndex(
  (acc) => acc.email === newAccount.email
);
if (existingIndex >= 0) {
  // Update existing account (don't add duplicate)
  updated[existingIndex] = newAccount;
} else {
  // Add genuinely new account
  updated.push(newAccount);
}
```

### 4. **Better UX**

- ✅ Loading indicator during validation
- ✅ Clear console logging
- ✅ Safe mode still works

## 🧪 Test Results Expected

### Before Fix:

```
Page refresh → 2 accounts
Page refresh → 4 accounts
Page refresh → 6 accounts (duplicates keep growing!)
```

### After Fix:

```
Page refresh → 2 accounts
Page refresh → 2 accounts (same accounts, no duplicates!)
Page refresh → 2 accounts (stable!)
```

## 📝 Console Messages to Look For

**Good (working correctly):**

```
🔄 Starting account management...
📂 Loaded 2 accounts from localStorage
📂 Found 2 session accounts
⏳ Validating user@example.com...
✅ Valid token for user@example.com
🎉 Account validation complete: 2 valid accounts
```

**If you see duplicates being prevented:**

```
🔄 Updated account: user@example.com (instead of ➕ Added account)
```

The duplicate issue should now be completely resolved! 🎉
